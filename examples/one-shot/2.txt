Example:

The story of Harry Potter follows the young wizard of the same name through his extraordinary life in the magical universe and his struggle against the evil sorcerer Lord Voldemort. Harry is raised by his non-magical aunt and uncle, the Dursleys, after the death of his parents at the hands of Voldemort, a dark wizard who attempted to kill Harry when he was just a baby.
At the age of eleven, Harry discovers he is a wizard and is invited to attend Hogwarts, the prestigious school of witchcraft and wizardry. There, he befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and is sorted into the Gryffindor house. During his time at Hogwarts, Harry learns of his identity as "The Boy Who Lived," the only known wizard to survive Voldemort's attack. He also learns of Voldemort's dark history and his quest for power through Horcruxes, objects in which he has hidden fragments of his soul to ensure his immortality.
Harry faces numerous dangers during his years at Hogwarts, including magical creatures, pursuits, and dark intrigues. With the help of his friends and teachers, he manages to defeat threats such as Salazar Slytherin's basilisk, the Dark Lord Quirinus Quirrell, and the talking hat of Slytherin House.
The struggle between Harry and Voldemort reaches its climax in the final book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." Harry discovers the existence of the remaining Horcruxes and embarks on a dangerous mission to destroy them, while Voldemort strengthens his grip on the magical world and begins an relentless hunt to kill Harry.
In the end, Harry realizes that he himself is an unintentional Horcrux, created when Voldemort attempted to kill him as a child. Accepting his fate, he surrenders himself to Voldemort to protect his friends and defeat the Dark Lord once and for all. During the final battle, many lives are lost, including Harry's, but he survives thanks to the sacrifice of his mother, Lily Potter, who protected him with a love spell.
After Voldemort's defeat, Harry recovers and becomes an Auror, a hunter of dark wizards, marries Ginny Weasley, and has three children. The series' epilogue shows Harry accompanying his youngest son, Albus Severus, to King's Cross Station for his first day at Hogwarts, leaving the dark past behind as the future unfolds before them.
